        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What's the surprise? When the <strong>Stu Surprise</strong> was added to the Sims games, we were given no other info, so we may never know.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, it looks delicious! Fans have been trying to recreate it, and so here is a <em>tentative</em> recipe for it.</em></p>
        <p>This recipe serves 4.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 &frac12; pounds braising steak, cut into 2.5cm cubes</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 medium white onion, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium celery stalk, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. tomato paste</li>
            <li>&frac13; cup dry red wine</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1cm pieces</li>
            <li>2 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1cm cubes</li>
            <li>1 can of french onion soup</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>&frac12; tsp. ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a larg zip-top bag, add beef and flour. Shake until beef cubes are coated in flour. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottom pot with lid over medium-high heat, add oil.</li>
            <li>Once hot, remove coated beef cubes from bag and shake off excess flour, then add to pot, leaving about 1cm between each cube.</li>
            <li>Brown well on all sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate and repeat browning with remaining beef, and transfer it to the same plate.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and add onion and celery. Cook until just tender, it should take about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and tomato paste. Cook until garlic is very fragrant and tomato paste is darker in colour. It should again take around 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add wine and scrape bottom of the pan to loosen any brown bits, then let the wine reduce by half. It should take about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Return the beef to the pot along with any collected juices, then add remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Stir well, then bring to a boil over high heat and cover with lid, leaving one side slightly vented.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 2&frac12; hours or until beef is fork-tener.</li>
            <li>Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
