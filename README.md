# Odin Recipes
Odin Recipes is a practice basic recipe website. It's an assignment from the Foundations Course of the Odin Project. I decided to make it inspired by 'the Sims'.

## Comment
I hope to put into practice the very basic html and css skills I've learnt so far by creating an index page, linking to some recipes and styling it.
I also hope to get used to committing my projects often and writing good commit messages.

## Skills Practiced
Committing regularly and writing commit messages.
Using basic html to:
- create simple pages
- create paragraphs, headings, bold and italicized text
- create ordered and unordered lists
- create relative links
- have links open in a new page
- display images both using absolute and relative paths
Using basic css to style my pages.
