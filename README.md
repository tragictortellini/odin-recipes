# Odin Recipes
Odin Recipes is a practice basic recipe website. It's an assignment from the Foundations Course of the Odin Project.

## Comment
I hope to put into practice the very basic html skills I've learnt so far by creating an index page and linking to some recipes.
I also hope to get used to committing my projects often and writing good commit messages.
I also plan to try and remember to keep this README updated.

## Future
I will use update this project when it's time to practice CSS.
